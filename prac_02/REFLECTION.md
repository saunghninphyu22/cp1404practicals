# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

80%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I usually watch lecture videos before I play game at night and during the breaks between classes
at school. I tend to watch 1 to 2 videos each time.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Finishing the lecture videos before practicals.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

When I watch lecture videos, I tend to lose focus even though they are short videos.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I tend to be very lazy to run the code. When I believe it works, I wouldn't check multiple times.


## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Following the template and methods from CP1404 github. It helps me simplize the steps and think
clearly about the solution.
