## Key Lessons Learned About Clean Code

- **Meaningful Naming:** Using descriptive and clear variable, function, and class names to ensure code is self-documenting.
- **Consistent Formatting:** Using proper indentation, spacing, and organization to make code easier to read and maintain.
- **Modularisation:** Breaking code up into small, reusable functions and classes to avoid duplication and improve clarity.
